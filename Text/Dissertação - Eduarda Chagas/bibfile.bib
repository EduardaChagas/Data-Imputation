Three public data sets were used: (i) Mobile Century data set collected on Highway I-880, near Union City, California; (ii) Borl\"ange GPS data set collected in the Swedish city of Borl\"ange; and (iii) Beijing taxicabs data set collected in Beijing, China, where each vehicle speed is stored as a time series. The Bandt-Pompe methodology combined with the Complexity-Entropy plane were used to identify different regimes and behaviors. The global velocity is compatible with a correlated noise with $f^{-k}$ Power Spectrum with $k \ge 0$. With this we identify traffic behaviors as, for instance, random velocities ($k\approx 0$) when there is congestion, and more correlated velocities ($k \approx 3$) in the presence of free traffic flow.},

The proposal uses the Shannon entropy, the statistical complexity, and the Fisher information evaluated over the Bandt and Pompe symbolization of the horizontal and vertical coordinates of signatures. These six features are easy and fast to compute, and they are the input to an One-Class Support Vector Machine classifier. The results are better than state-of-the-art online techniques that employ higher-dimensional feature spaces which often require specialized software and hardware. We assess the consistency of our proposal with respect to the size of the training sample, and we also use it to classify the signatures into meaningful groups.},

abstract = { Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are growing in popularity as a complement or alternative to the traditional command line interfaces to R. RGtk2 is an R package for creating GUIs in R. The package provides programmatic access to GTK+ 2.0, an open-source GUI toolkit written in C. To construct a GUI, the R programmer calls RGtk2 functions that map to functions in the underlying GTK+ library. This paper introduces the basic concepts underlying GTK+ and explains how to use RGtk2 to construct GUIs from R. The tutorial is based on simple and pratical programming examples. We also provide more complex examples illustrating the advanced features of the package. The design of the RGtk2 API and the low-level interface from R to GTK+ are discussed at length. We compare RGtk2 to alternative GUI toolkits for R.},

	iterates of a point x under a self-map f of the interval I = {[}0, 1] is
	called an order pattern. For fixed f and n, measuring the points x is an
	element of I (according to Lebesgue measure) that generate the order
	pattern sigma gives a probability distribution mu(n)(f) on the set of
	length n permutations. We study the distributions that arise this way
	for various classes of functions f.
	Our main results treat the class of measure-preserving functions. We
	obtain an exact description of the set of realizable distributions in
	this case: for each n this set is a union of open faces of the polytope
	of flows on a certain digraph, and a simple combinatorial criterion
	determines which faces are included. We also show that for general f,
	apart from an obvious compatibility condition, there is no restriction
	on the sequence \{mu(n)(f)\}(n = 1,2,...).
	In addition, we give a necessary condition for f to have finite
	exclusion type, that is, for there to be finitely many order patterns
	that generate all order patterns not realized by f. Using entropy we
	show that if f is piecewise continuous, piecewise monotone, and either
	ergodic or with points of arbitrarily high period, then f cannot have
	finite exclusion type. This generalizes results of S. Elizalde.}},

  abstract = {Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides consistent information on target land features; especially in tropical conditions that restrain penetration of optical imaging sensors. Because radar response signal is influenced by geometric and di-electrical properties of surface features’, the different land cover may appear similar in radar images. For discriminating perennial cocoa agroforestry land cover, we compare a multi-spectral optical image from RapidEye, acquired in the dry season, and multi-seasonal C-band SAR of Sentinel 1: A final set of 10 (out of 50) images that represent six dry and four wet seasons from 2015 to 2017. We ran eight RF models for different input band combinations; multi-spectral reflectance, vegetation indices, co-(VV) and cross-(VH) polarised SAR intensity and Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture measures. Following a pixel-based image analysis, we evaluated accuracy metrics and uncertainty Shannon entropy. The model comprising co- and cross-polarised texture bands had the highest accuracy of 88.07\% (95\% CI: 85.52 - 90.31) and kappa of 85.37; and the low class uncertainty for perennial agroforests and transition forests. The optical image had low classification uncertainty for the entire image; but, it performed better in discriminating non-vegetated areas. The measured uncertainty provides reliable validation for comparing class discrimination from different image resolution. The GLCM texture measures that are crucial in delineating vegetation cover differed for the season and polarization of SAR image. Given the high accuracies of mapping, our approach has value for landscape monitoring; and, an improved valuation of agroforestry contribution to REDD+ strategies in the Congo basin sub-region.},

  abstract  = {Background and objective: Signal segmentation and spike detection are two important biomedical signal processing applications. Often, non-stationary signals must be segmented into piece-wise stationary epochs or spikes need to be found among a background of noise before being further analyzed. Permutation entropy (PE) has been proposed to evaluate the irregularity of a time series. PE is conceptually simple, structurally robust to artifacts, and computationally fast. It has been extensively used in many applications, but it has two key shortcomings. First, when a signal is symbolized using the Bandt-Pompe procedure, only the order of the amplitude values is considered and information regarding the amplitudes is discarded. Second, in the PE, the effect of equal amplitude values in each embedded vector is not addressed. To address these issues, we propose a new entropy measure based on PE: the amplitude-aware permutation entropy (AAPE). Methods: AAPE is sensitive to the changes in the amplitude, in addition to the frequency, of the signals thanks to it being more flexible than the classical PE in the quantification of the signal motifs. To demonstrate how the AAPE method can enhance the quality of the signal segmentation and spike detection, a set of synthetic and realistic synthetic neuronal signals, electroencephalograms and neuronal data are processed. We compare the performance of AAPE in these problems against state-of-the-art approaches and evaluate the significance of the differences with a repeated ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's test. Results: In signal segmentation, the accuracy of AAPE-based method is higher than conventional segmentation methods. AAPE also leads to more robust results in the presence of noise. The spike detection results show that AAPE can detect spikes well, even when presented with single-sample spikes, unlike PE. For multi-sample spikes, the changes in AAPE are larger than in PE. Conclusion: We introduce a new entropy metric, AAPE, that enables us to consider amplitude information in the formulation of PE. The AAPE algorithm can be used in almost every irregularity-based application in various signal and image processing fields. We also made freely available the Matlab code of the AAPE.},

However, the reliability of such measures depends on the appropriate selection of parameters and the need for large time series. In this paper we present a method for the characterization of distinct time series behaviors based on the probability of self-transitions, a measure extracted from their transformation onto ordinal patterns transition graphs. We validate our method by investigating the main characteristics of periodic, random, and chaotic time series. By the application of learning strategies, we precisely classify different randomness levels in time series, reaching 100\% in accuracy, and advances in performing the hard task of distinguishing random noises from chaotic time series, correctly distinguishing 96.61\% of the cases. Furthermore, we show that this strategy is well suitable to be used by many applications, even for short time series, and does not depend on the selection of parameters.},

First, we introduce a fixed time lag for the elements of each partition that is selected using techniques from traditional time delay embedding. The resulting partitions define regions in the embedding phase space that are mapped to nodes in the network space. Edges are allocated between nodes based on temporal succession thus creating a Markov chain representation of the time series. We then apply this new transformation algorithm to time series generated by the Rössler system and find that periodic dynamics translate to ring structures whereas chaotic time series translate to band or tube-like structures—thereby indicating that our algorithm generates networks whose structure is sensitive to system dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple network measures including the mean out degree and variance of out degrees can track changes in the dynamical behaviour in a manner comparable to the largest Lyapunov exponent. We also apply the same analysis to experimental time series generated by a diode resonator circuit and show that the network size, mean shortest path length, and network diameter are highly sensitive to the interior crisis captured in this particular data set.},

In order to deal with the classification issue, we propose to use a new fuzzy version of hidden Markov chains (HMCs), and thus to address fuzzy change detection with a statistical approach. The main characteristic of the proposed model is to simultaneously use Dirac and Lebesgue measures at the class chain level. This allows the coexistence of hard pixels (obtained with the classical HMC segmentation) and fuzzy pixels (obtained with the fuzzy measure) in the same image. The quality assessment of the proposed method is achieved with several bidate sets of simulated images, and comparisons with classical HMC are also provided. Experimental results on real European Remote Sensing 2 Precision Image (ERS-2 PRI) images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Optical excitable devices that mimic neuronal behavior can be building-blocks of novel, brain-inspired information processing systems. A relevant issue is to understand how such systems represent, via correlated spikes, the information of a weak external input. Semiconductor lasers with optical feedback operating in the low frequency fluctuations regime have been shown to display optical spikes with intrinsic temporal correlations similar to those of biological neurons. Here we investigate how the spiking laser output represents a weak periodic input that is implemented via direct modulation of the laser pump current. We focus on understanding the influence of the modulation frequency. Experimental sequences of inter-spike-intervals (ISIs) are recorded and analyzed by using the ordinal symbolic methodology that identifies and characterizes serial correlations in datasets. The change in the statistics of the various symbols with the modulation frequency is empirically shown to be related to specific changes in the ISI distribution, which arise due to different phase-locking regimes. A good qualitative agreement is also found between simulations of the Lang and Kobayashi model and observations. This methodology is an efficient way to detect subtle changes in noisy correlated ISI sequences and may be applied to investigate other optical excitable devices.},

This event highlighted the importance of an operational sea-ice classification map for ice routing to serve ship navigation. In this paper, unprecedented Antarctic sea-ice classification algorithms from RADARSAT-2 satellite dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were developed using the conditional random fields (CRF) approach by including multiple features from sea-ice concentration, gray-level cooccurrence matrix textures, polarization ratio, backscatter coefficients, and intensity data. Coincident RADARSAT-2 Satellite SAR datasets with five scenes were collected for ice classification into categories such as open water, thin ice, smooth first year ice, deformed first year ice, and old ice during the CHINARE-30th cruise. The effects of deformation, rafting, and ridging during the spring-summer transition period were overwhelmed by the spatial and contextual CRF models in combination with the rich features extracted for sea-ice classification. Four strategies including statistical distribution and region connection, multiple features and support vector machine (SVM) integrated into the CRF model are proposed to describe the sea-ice-type relationships among pixels. By conducting comparative experiments between the proposed methods and state-of-the-art sea-ice classification based on the SVM algorithm, the best was obtained from the SVM-based CRF (SVM-CRF) algorithm for sea-ice classification with respect to the three scenes from the Indian Ocean sector and two scenes of Pacific Ocean sectors including medium-resolution dual-polarization SAR imagery with a pixel spacing of 50 m and higher resolution dual-polarization SAR imagery with a pixel spacing of 6.25 m. Results indicate that the SVM-CRF approach has the capacity for improving sea-ice classification, which can provide accurate and reliable sea-ice class information for sea-ice analysis.},

A measure of the total output power is used to select the center frequency of the filter and is used to estimate the Rician statistics of the Gabor-filtered image. The method is further generalized to include the statistics of postfiltered outputs that are generated by a Gaussian filtering operation following the Gabor filter.

However, speckle, inherent of active coherent imaging systems, diminishes the performances of feature extraction techniques and classifiers. In this article, we firstly present a simple yet powerful feature extraction method based on the covariance matrix of textural feature. In comparison with the original textural feature, the use of second-order statistics makes the proposed covariance descriptor more distinguishable for various land covers and robust to speckle noise. Considering that the covariance descriptors are symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices which form a Riemannian manifold, we then propose to map the manifold with Log-Euclidean metric in a high dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space by means of the positive definite kernel defined on manifolds. As a result, the kernel not only allows us to make full use of algorithms developed for linear spaces but also preserves geometric structure of SPD matrices. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can provide promising results in terms of classification accuracy and label consistency.},

The method relies on the fact that patterns may be too disparate in amplitudes and variances and proceeds by assigning weights for each extracted vector when computing the relative frequencies associated with every motif. Simulations were conducted over synthetic and real data for a weighting scheme inspired by the variance of each pattern. Results show better robustness and stability in the presence of higher levels of noise, in addition to a distinctive ability to extract complexity information from data with spiky features or having abrupt changes in magnitude.},

This approach yields weighted directed networks representing the pattern transition properties of time series in velocity space, which hence provides dynamic insights of the underling system. Furthermore, we propose a measure of entropy to characterize ordinal partition transition dynamics, which is sensitive to capturing the possible local geometric changes of phase space trajectories. We demonstrate the applicability of pattern transition networks to capture phase coherence to non-coherence transitions, and to characterize paths to phase synchronizations.

  abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) data from patients with a variety of heart conditions are studied using ordinal pattern partition networks. The ordinal pattern partition networks are formed from the ECG time series by symbolizing the data into ordinal patterns. The ordinal patterns form the nodes of the network and edges are defined through the time ordering of the ordinal patterns in the symbolized time series. A network measure, called the mean degree, is computed from each time series-generated network. In addition, the entropy and number of non-occurring ordinal patterns (NFP) is computed for each series. The distribution of mean degrees, entropies, and NFPs for each heart condition studied is compared. A statistically significant difference between healthy patients and several groups of unhealthy patients with varying heart conditions is found for the distributions of the mean degrees, unlike for any of the distributions of the entropies or NFPs.},

  abstract  = {Classification based on polarimetric data alone does not provide sufficient sensitivity for classes’ separation such as forests. The use of other characteristics such as texture provides a powerful tool to get better class discrimination. Thus, this article outlines an approach for texture modelling adapted to land identification using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar ({P}ol{SAR}) images. As radar images may contain a myriad of textures and to take into account their non-stationarity feature, the model is non-parametric and is based on a likeness measure between neighbourhoods. This measure is incorporated in probability formulation of the textural model. The latter is validated through texture synthesis applied to Brodatz’ natural textures. While having multiple applications, we focused here on the issue of terrain mapping of {P}ol{SAR} images. Using Bayesian approach and some basic assumptions, we defined a classification scheme based on the textural model. It was tested on original Pauli decomposed images and filtered ones. The test area used is the Oberpfaffenhofen in Munich and the {P}ol{SAR} images were acquired in the P band. For evaluation purposes, the classifications results obtained were compared with the Wishart classifier result performed on H–α partition showing interesting results and reaching classification rates = 90\%. Such an analysis has allowed us to assess the importance of texture considering and proved that the proposed texture model is able to describe the target's physical properties of {P}ol{SAR} data.},

  abstract  = {Earth Observation (EO) data plays a major role in supporting surveying compliance of several multilateral environmental treaties, such as UN-REDD+ (United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation). In this context, land cover maps of remote sensing data are the most commonly used EO products and development of adequate classification strategies is an ongoing research topic. However, the availability of meaningful multispectral data sets can be limited due to cloud cover, particularly in the tropics. In such regions, the use of SAR systems (Synthetic Aperture Radar), which are nearly independent form weather conditions, is particularly promising. With an ever-growing number of SAR satellites, as well as the increasing accessibility of SAR data, potentials for multi-frequency remote sensing are becoming numerous. In our study, we evaluate the synergistic contribution of multitemporal L-, C-, and X-band data to tropical land cover mapping. We compare classification outcomes of ALOS-2, RADARSAT-2, and TerraSAR-X datasets for a study site in the Brazilian Amazon using a wrapper approach. After preprocessing and calculation of GLCM texture (Grey Level Co-Occurence), the wrapper utilizes Random Forest classifications to estimate scene importance. Comparing the contribution of different wavelengths, ALOS-2 data perform best in terms of overall classification accuracy, while the classification of TerraSAR-X data yields higher accuracies when compared to the results achieved by RADARSAT-2. Moreover, the wrapper underlines potentials of multi-frequency classification as integration of multi-frequency images is always preferred over multi-temporal, mono-frequent composites. We conclude that, despite distinct advantages of certain sensors, for land cover classification, multi-sensoral integration is beneficial.},

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can potentially penetrate vegetation canopies and assist geological mapping in this environment. This study applies manual and automated lithological classification methods to airborne polarimetric TopSAR and geophysical data in the Heazlewood region, western Tasmania. Major discrepancies between classification results and the existing geological map generated fieldwork targets that led to the discovery of previously unmapped rock units. Manual analysis of radar image texture was essential for the identification of lithological boundaries. Automated pixel-based classification of radar data using Random Forests achieved poor results despite the inclusion of textural information derived from gray level co-occurrence matrices. This is because the majority of manually identified features within the radar imagery result from geobotanical and geomorphological relationships, rather than direct imaging of surficial lithological variations. Inconsistent relationships between geology and vegetation or geology and topography limit the reliability of TopSAR interpretations for geological mapping in this environment. However, Random Forest classifications, based on geophysical data and validated against manual interpretations, were accurate (~90\%) even when using limited training data (~0.15\% of total data). These classifications identified a previously unmapped region of mafic-ultramafic rocks, the presence of which was verified through fieldwork. This study validates the application of machine learning for geological mapping in remote and inaccessible localities but also highlights the limitations of SAR data in thickly vegetated terrain.},

Failures are defined here as a temporal process defined in a sequence. Robustness is then evaluated by measuring dissimilarities between topologies after each time step of the sequence, providing a dynamical information about the topological damage. We thoroughly analyze the efficiency of the method in capturing small perturbations by considering different probability distributions on networks. In particular, we find that distributions based on distances are more consistent in capturing network structural deviations, as better reflect the consequences of the failures.

  abstract = {Currently, the amount of collected Earth Observation (EO) data is increasing considerably with a rate of several Terabytes of data per day. As a consequence of this increasing data volume, new concepts for exploration and information retrieval are urgently needed. To this end, we propose to explore satellite image data via an image information mining (IIM) approach in which the main steps are feature extraction, classification, semantic annotation, and interactive query processing. This leads to a new process chain and a robust taxonomy for the retrieved categories capitalizing on human interaction and judgment. We concentrated on land cover categories that can be retrieved from high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the spaceborne TerraSAR-X instrument, where we annotated different urban areas all over the world and defined a taxonomy element for each prevailing surface cover category. The annotation resulted from a test dataset comprising more than 100 scenes covering diverse areas of Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North and South America. The scenes were grouped into several collections with similar source areas and each collection was processed separately in order to discern regional characteristics. In the first processing step, each scene was tiled into patches. Then the features were extracted from each patch by a Gabor filter bank and a support vector machine with relevance feedback classifying the feature sets into user-oriented land cover categories. Finally, the categories were semantically annotated using Google Earth for ground truthing. The annotation followed a multilevel approach that allowed the fusion of information being visible on different resolution levels. The novelty of this paper lies in the fact that a semantic annotation was performed with a large number of high-resolution radar images that allowed the definition of more than 850 surface cover categories. This opens the way toward an automated identification and classification of urban areas, infrastructure (e.g., airports), geographic objects (e.g., mountains), industrial installations, military compounds, vegetation, and agriculture. Applications that may result from this work can be a semantic catalog of urban images to be used in crisis situations or after a disaster. In addition, the proposed taxonomies can become a basis for building a semantic catalog of satellite images. Finally, we defined four powerful types of high-level queries. Querying on such high levels provides new opportunities for users to search an image database for specific parameters or semantic relationships.},

SAR images cannot be segmented successfully by using traditional methods because of the existence of speckle noise in SAR images. The algorithm, proposed in this paper, extracts the texture feature by using wavelet transform; then, it forms a feature vector composed of kurtosis value of wavelet energy feature of SAR image. In the next step, segmentation of different textures is applied by using feature vector and level set function. At last, an SVM classifier is designed and trained by using normalized feature vectors of each region texture. The testing sets of SAR images are segmented by this trained SVM. Experimental results on both agricultural and urban SAR images show that the proposed algorithm is effective for classification of different textures in SAR images, and it is also insensitive to the intensity.},

Unlike other algorithms that classify pixels statistically and ignore their scattering characteristics, this algorithm not only uses a statistical classifier, but also preserves the purity of dominant polarimetric scattering properties. This algorithm uses a combination of a scattering model-based decomposition developed by Freeman and Durden and the maximum-likelihood classifier based on the complex Wishart distribution. The first step is to apply the Freeman and Durden decomposition to divide pixels into three scattering categories: surface scattering, volume scattering, and double-bounce scattering. To preserve the purity of scattering characteristics, pixels in a scattering category are restricted to be classified with other pixels in the same scattering category. An efficient and effective class initialization scheme is also devised to initially merge clusters from many small clusters in each scattering category by applying a merge criterion developed based on the Wishart distance measure. Then, the iterative Wishart classifier is applied. The stability in convergence is much superior to that of the previous algorithm using the entropy/anisotropy/Wishart classifier. Finally, an automated color rendering scheme is proposed, based on the classes' scattering category to code the pixels to resemble their natural color. This algorithm is also flexible and computationally efficient. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated using the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's AIRSAR and the German Aerospace Center's (DLR) E-SAR L-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar images.},

The algorithm firstly generates an initial classification map by multi-level feature extraction, and then introduces Wishart classifier into the iterative classification to refine the initial. At the first level, the {P}ol{SAR} image is classified into four categories by combining entropy and anisotropy features that are extracted from Cloude-Pottier decomposition. From the scattering mechanisms, the second-level classification is conducted with the surface, double-bounce and volume scattering power obtained from three-component decompression. Accordingly, the {P}ol{SAR} image is further divided into 13 categories. Finally, to discriminate objects with similar polarimetric characteristics but different scattering power, the total scattering power is adopted to classify the {P}ol{SAR} image into 26 categories at the third level. Experiments on some real {P}ol{SAR} images acquired by AIRSAR system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

Given a large-scale SAR land cover dataset collected from TerraSAR-X images with a hierarchical three-level annotation of 150 categories and comprising more than 100,000 patches, three main challenges in automatically interpreting SAR images of highly imbalanced classes, geographic diversity, and label noise are addressed. In this letter, a deep transfer learning method is proposed based on a similarly annotated optical land cover dataset (NWPU-RESISC45). Besides, a top-2 smooth loss function with cost-sensitive parameters was introduced to tackle the label noise and imbalanced classes’ problems. The proposed method shows high efficiency in transferring information from a similarly annotated remote sensing dataset, a robust performance on highly imbalanced classes, and is alleviating the over-fitting problem caused by label noise. What’s more, the learned deep model has a good generalization for other SAR-specific tasks, such as MSTAR target recognition with a state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 99.46\%.},

  abstract  = {Due to that polarimetric synthetic aperture radar ({P}ol{SAR}) data suffers from missing labeled samples and complex-valued data, this article presents a novel semi-supervised {P}ol{SAR} terrain classification method named recurrent complex-valued convolution neural network (RCV-CNN) which combines semi-supervised learning and complex-valued convolution neural network (CV-CNN). The proposed method only needs a small number of labeled samples to achieve good classification results. First, a Wishart classifier is used to select some reliable {P}ol{SAR} samples. Then, two new semi-supervised deep classification model RCV-CNN1 and RCV-CNN2 have been proposed to improve {P}ol{SAR} image classification accuracy. Moreover, our proposed methods could solve the problem of network overfitting phenomenon to some extend when the number of training samples is too small. Finally, three real {P}ol{SAR} dataset are applied to verify the effectiveness of our algorithms. Compared with the other five state-of-the-art methods, the proposed RCV-CNN1 and RCV-CNN2 classification models show good performance in accuracy and generalization.},

  abstract  = {Multisource remote sensing data have been widely used to improve land-cover classifications. The combination of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical imagery can detect different land-cover types, and the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) and support vector machines (SVMs) can lead to improved classifications. Moreover, SVM kernel parameters and feature selection affect the classification accuracy. Thus, a GA was implemented for feature selection and parameter optimization. In this letter, a GA-SVM algorithm was proposed as a method of classifying multifrequency RADARSAT-2 (RS2) SAR images and Thaichote (THEOS) multispectral images. The results of the GA-SVM algorithm were compared with those of the grid search algorithm, a traditional method of parameter searching. The results showed that the GA-SVM algorithm outperformed the grid search approach and provided higher classification accuracy using fewer input features. The images obtained by fusing RS2 data and THEOS data provided high classification accuracy at over 95\%. The results showed improved classification accuracy and demonstrated the advantages of using the GA-SVM algorithm, which provided the best accuracy using fewer features.},

  abstract  = {Early and on-going crop production forecasts are important to facilitate food price stability for regions at risk, and for agriculture exporters, to set market value. Most regional and global efforts in forecasting rely on multiple sources of information from the field. With increased access to data from spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), these sensors could contribute information on crop acreage. But these acreage estimates must be available early in the season to assist with production forecasts. This study acquired TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2 data over a region in eastern Canada dominated by economically important corn and soybean production. Using a supervised decision tree classifier, results determined that either sensor was capable of delivering highly accurate maps of corn and soybeans at the end of the growing season. Accuracies far exceeded 90\%. Spatial and multi-temporal filtering approaches were compared and small improvements in accuracies were found by applying the multi-temporal filter to the RADARSAT-2 data. Of significant interest, this study determined that by using only three TerraSAR-X images corn could be accurately identified by the end of June, a mere six weeks after planting and at a vegetative growth stage (V6 – sixth leaf collar developed). However, soybeans required additional acquisitions given the variance in planting densities and planting dates in this region of Canada. In this case, accurate soybean classification required TerraSAR-X images until early August at the start of the reproductive stage (R5 – seed development is beginning). Also important, by applying a multi-temporal filter accurate mapping (close to 90\%) of corn and soybeans from RADARSAT-2 could occur five weeks earlier (by August 19) than if a spatial filter was used. Thus application of this filtering approach could accelerate delivery of a crop inventory for this region of Canada. Corn and soybeans are important commodities both globally and within Canada. This study makes an important contribution as it demonstrates that TerraSAR-X can deliver acreage estimates of these two crops early enough to assist with in-season production forecasting.},

  abstract  = {The deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely used for target classification, because it can learn highly useful representations from data. However, it is difficult to apply a CNN for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) target classification directly, for it often requires a large volume of labeled training data, which is impractical for SAR applications. The highway network is a newly proposed architecture based on CNN that can be trained with smaller data sets. This letter proposes a novel architecture called the convolutional highway unit to train deeper networks with limited SAR data. The unit architecture is formed by modified convolutional highway layers, a maxpool layer, and a dropout layer. Then, the networks can be flexibly formed by stacking the unit architecture to extract deep feature representations for classification. Experimental results on the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition data set indicate that the branched ensemble model based on the unit architecture can achieve 99\% classification accuracy with all training data. When the training data are reduced to 30\%, the classification accuracy of the ensemble model can still reach 94.97\%.},

Performance of our implementation is examined by utilizing a time series of ScanSAR images in the Western Barents Sea, acquired in spring 2013. The network is trained on the initial image of the time series and then applied to subsequent images. We obtain a reasonable classification accuracy of at least 70\% depending on the choice of our ice-type regime, when the incidence angle range of the training data matches that of the classified image.

  abstract  = {Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar ({P}ol{SAR}) has become increasingly popular in the past two decades, for it can derive multichannel features of ground objects, which contains more discriminative information compared with traditional SAR. In this paper, a neural nonlocal stacked sparse autoencoders with virtual adversarial regularization (NNSSAE-VAT) is proposed for {P}ol{SAR} image classification. The NNSSAE first extracts the nonlocal features by calculating pairwise similarity of each pixel and its surrounding pixels using a neural network, which contains a multiscale feature extractor and a linear embedding layer. The feature extraction process can relieve the negative influence of speckle noise and extract discriminative nonlocal spatial information without carefully designed parameters. Then, the SSAE maps the center pixel and the extracted nonlocal features into deep latent space in which a Softmax classifier is utilized to conduct classification. The virtual adversarial training is introduced to regularize the network, which tries to keep the network from being overfitting. The experimental results from three real {P}ol{SAR} image show that the proposed NNSSAE-VAT method has proved its robustness and effectiveness and it can achieve competitive performance compared with related methods.},

Deep models are usually generated by stacking similar modules, e.g., restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), and they are especially suitable for discriminating complex objects through the use of ‘big data’. However, object-oriented classification (OOC) for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar ({P}ol{SAR}) imagery is based on homogeneous regions instead of pixels, which results in a degraded performance for the deep models, as the data volume is inadequate. To solve this problem, we adopt an RBM as the module, and use it to construct an adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) model instead of a stacked deep model, to carry out OOC for {P}ol{SAR} imagery. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to the stacked RBM model and the other common methods for OOC.},

  abstract  = {Based on a generative adversarial network (GAN), a novel version named Task-Oriented GAN is proposed to tackle difficulties in {P}ol{SAR} image interpretation, including {P}ol{SAR} data analysis and small sample problem. Besides two typical parts in GAN, i.e., generator (G-Net) and discriminator (D-Net), there is a third part named TaskNet (T-Net) in the Task-Oriented GAN, where T-Net is employed to accomplish a certain task. Two tasks, {P}ol{SAR} image classification and clustering, are studied in this paper, where T-Net acts as a Classifier and a Clusterer, respectively. The learning procedure of Task-Oriented GAN consists of two main stages. In the first stage, G-Net and D-Net vie with each other like that in a general GAN; in the second stage, G-Net is adjusted and oriented by T-Net so that more samples, which are benefit for the task and called fake data, are generated. As a result, Task-Oriented GAN not only has the advantage of GAN (no-assumption data modeling) but also overcomes the disadvantage of GAN (task-free). After learning, fake data are employed to enrich training set and avoid overfitting; so Task-Oriented GAN performs well even if the manual-labeled data are small. To verify the effectiveness of T-Net, a visualized comparison is provided, where some fake digits generated from Task-Oriented GAN are illustrated along with that from GAN. What is more, considering that there is a great difference between {P}ol{SAR} data and general data, in our {P}ol{SAR} image classification and clustering tasks, the specific {P}ol{SAR} information is inserted into the structure of the Task-Oriented GAN. This enables researchers to mine inherent information in {P}ol{SAR} data without any data hypothesis and find ways for small sample problem at the same time. Experiment results tested on three {P}ol{SAR} images show that the proposed method performs well in dealing with {P}ol{SAR} image classification and clustering.},

    This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (in casu, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper presents experimental results on a standard evaluation set, as well as on imagery obtained in the context of a real-life object recognition application.

The problems of representing a signal by its short-time Fourier transform and synthesizing a signal from its transform are considered. A new synthesis equation is introduced that is sufficiently general to describe apparently different synthesis methods reported in the literature. It is shown that a class of linear-filtering problems can be represented as the product of the time-varying frequency response of the filter multiplied by the short-time Fourier transform of the input signal. The representation of a signal by samples of its short-time Fourier transform is applied to the linear filtering problem. This representation is of practical significance because there exists a computationally efficient algorithm for implementing such systems. Finally, the methods of fast convolution age considered as special cases of this representation.},

  Abstract                 = {Wireless sensor networks are an important technology for making distributed autonomous measures in hostile or inaccessible environments. Among the challenges they pose, the way data travel among them is a relevant issue since their structure is quite dynamic. The operational topology of such devices can often be described by complex networks. In this work, we assess the variation of measures commonly employed in the complex networks literature applied to wireless sensor networks. Four data communication strategies were considered: geometric, random, small-world, and scale-free models, along with the shortest path length measure. The sensitivity of this measure was analyzed with respect to the following perturbations: insertion and removal of nodes in the geometric strategy; and insertion, removal and rewiring of links in the other models. The assessment was performed using the normalized Kullback-Leibler divergence and Hellinger distance quantifiers, both deriving from the Information Theory framework. The results reveal that the shortest path length is sensitive to perturbations},
