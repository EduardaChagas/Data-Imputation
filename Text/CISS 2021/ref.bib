  abstract  = {With the development of remote sensing systems, the scale of the imaging data grows rapidly, which highly requires appropriate adaptability for interpretation algorithms. Focusing on this trend, an unsupervised classification algorithm for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar ({P}ol{SAR}) images is proposed based on multi-level feature extraction. The algorithm firstly generates an initial classification map by multi-level feature extraction, and then introduces Wishart classifier into the iterative classification to refine the initial. At the first level, the {P}ol{SAR} image is classified into four categories by combining entropy and anisotropy features that are extracted from Cloude-Pottier decomposition. From the scattering mechanisms, the second-level classification is conducted with the surface, double-bounce and volume scattering power obtained from three-component decompression. Accordingly, the {P}ol{SAR} image is further divided into 13 categories. Finally, to discriminate objects with similar polarimetric characteristics but different scattering power, the total scattering power is adopted to classify the {P}ol{SAR} image into 26 categories at the third level. Experiments on some real {P}ol{SAR} images acquired by AIRSAR system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

  abstract = {The classification of large-scale high-resolution SAR land cover images acquired by satellites is a challenging task, facing several difficulties such as semantic annotation with expertise, changing data characteristics due to varying imaging parameters or regional target area differences, and complex scattering mechanisms being different from optical imaging. Given a large-scale SAR land cover dataset collected from TerraSAR-X images with a hierarchical three-level annotation of 150 categories and comprising more than 100,000 patches, three main challenges in automatically interpreting SAR images of highly imbalanced classes, geographic diversity, and label noise are addressed. In this letter, a deep transfer learning method is proposed based on a similarly annotated optical land cover dataset (NWPU-RESISC45). Besides, a top-2 smooth loss function with cost-sensitive parameters was introduced to tackle the label noise and imbalanced classes’ problems. The proposed method shows high efficiency in transferring information from a similarly annotated remote sensing dataset, a robust performance on highly imbalanced classes, and is alleviating the over-fitting problem caused by label noise. What’s more, the learned deep model has a good generalization for other SAR-specific tasks, such as MSTAR target recognition with a state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 99.46\%.},

  abstract  = {Due to that polarimetric synthetic aperture radar ({P}ol{SAR}) data suffers from missing labeled samples and complex-valued data, this article presents a novel semi-supervised {P}ol{SAR} terrain classification method named recurrent complex-valued convolution neural network (RCV-CNN) which combines semi-supervised learning and complex-valued convolution neural network (CV-CNN). The proposed method only needs a small number of labeled samples to achieve good classification results. First, a Wishart classifier is used to select some reliable {P}ol{SAR} samples. Then, two new semi-supervised deep classification model RCV-CNN1 and RCV-CNN2 have been proposed to improve {P}ol{SAR} image classification accuracy. Moreover, our proposed methods could solve the problem of network overfitting phenomenon to some extend when the number of training samples is too small. Finally, three real {P}ol{SAR} dataset are applied to verify the effectiveness of our algorithms. Compared with the other five state-of-the-art methods, the proposed RCV-CNN1 and RCV-CNN2 classification models show good performance in accuracy and generalization.},

  abstract = {Strategies based on the extraction of measures from ordinal patterns transformation, such as probability distributions and transition graphs, have reached relevant advancements in distinguishing different time series dynamics. However, the reliability of such measures depends on the appropriate selection of parameters and the need for large time series. In this paper we present a method for the characterization of distinct time series behaviors based on the probability of self-transitions, a measure extracted from their transformation onto ordinal patterns transition graphs. We validate our method by investigating the main characteristics of periodic, random, and chaotic time series. By the application of learning strategies, we precisely classify different randomness levels in time series, reaching 100\% in accuracy, and advances in performing the hard task of distinguishing random noises from chaotic time series, correctly distinguishing 96.61\% of the cases. Furthermore, we show that this strategy is well suitable to be used by many applications, even for short time series, and does not depend on the selection of parameters.},

  abstract  = {Background and objective: Signal segmentation and spike detection are two important biomedical signal processing applications. Often, non-stationary signals must be segmented into piece-wise stationary epochs or spikes need to be found among a background of noise before being further analyzed. Permutation entropy (PE) has been proposed to evaluate the irregularity of a time series. PE is conceptually simple, structurally robust to artifacts, and computationally fast. It has been extensively used in many applications, but it has two key shortcomings. First, when a signal is symbolized using the Bandt-Pompe procedure, only the order of the amplitude values is considered and information regarding the amplitudes is discarded. Second, in the PE, the effect of equal amplitude values in each embedded vector is not addressed. To address these issues, we propose a new entropy measure based on PE: the amplitude-aware permutation entropy (AAPE). Methods: AAPE is sensitive to the changes in the amplitude, in addition to the frequency, of the signals thanks to it being more flexible than the classical PE in the quantification of the signal motifs. To demonstrate how the AAPE method can enhance the quality of the signal segmentation and spike detection, a set of synthetic and realistic synthetic neuronal signals, electroencephalograms and neuronal data are processed. We compare the performance of AAPE in these problems against state-of-the-art approaches and evaluate the significance of the differences with a repeated ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's test. Results: In signal segmentation, the accuracy of AAPE-based method is higher than conventional segmentation methods. AAPE also leads to more robust results in the presence of noise. The spike detection results show that AAPE can detect spikes well, even when presented with single-sample spikes, unlike PE. For multi-sample spikes, the changes in AAPE are larger than in PE. Conclusion: We introduce a new entropy metric, AAPE, that enables us to consider amplitude information in the formulation of PE. The AAPE algorithm can be used in almost every irregularity-based application in various signal and image processing fields. We also made freely available the Matlab code of the AAPE.},
